# Salesforce CRM Migration

## Overview
The organization was using an outdated CRM platform that fragmented client information across departments and caused inefficiencies in advisor workflows. The goal was to replace the legacy CRM with Salesforce Financial Services Cloud to streamline data access, improve advisor efficiency, and enable better client engagement insights.

## Business Problem
- Advisors were spending excessive time navigating multiple systems to access client data.  
- Fragmented systems resulted in duplicate records, compliance risks, and inconsistent client communications.  
- Lack of a centralized engagement view limited cross-sell opportunities and reduced client satisfaction.

## My Role & Contributions
- Conducted stakeholder interviews across Wealth Advisory, Compliance, Operations, and IT to gather system requirements.
- Led current-state vs future-state gap analysis between the legacy CRM and Salesforce features.
- Created detailed business requirements (BRD) covering over 100 system functions and data flows.
- Partnered with IT to define the data migration logic and validation requirements.
- Coordinated and led User Acceptance Testing (UAT) cycles, capturing and managing 70+ defects and enhancement requests using JIRA.
- Created process documentation and advisor quick-reference guides post-implementation.

## Challenges Faced
- Data mapping complexity between the legacy system and Salesforce schema.
- Multiple stakeholder groups had conflicting priorities for custom features.
- UAT timeline was compressed due to vendor delivery delays.

## Key Deliverables
- BRD and Functional Specs Document (Confluence + Excel)
- Data Mapping Document
- Visio diagrams of old vs. new client interaction workflows
- JIRA User Story Backlog and Test Case Matrix
- Training and rollout support material

## Business Outcomes & Impact
- 60% reduction in advisor data entry time  
- 40% increase in advisor satisfaction with client information access  
- 30% fewer support tickets related to client data inconsistencies  
- Improved compliance through better client data governance and audit traceability  
- Enabled future integration with marketing automation tools for targeted outreach
