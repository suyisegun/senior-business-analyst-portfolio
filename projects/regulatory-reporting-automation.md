# Regulatory Reporting Automation

## Overview
To meet growing regulatory scrutiny and reduce compliance risk, the organization aimed to automate regulatory reporting processes for FATCA, OSFI, and GDPR. Manual tracking and reporting posed significant risk and operational burden, especially with increasing data volumes and evolving reporting timelines.

## Business Problem
- Manual reporting processes were error-prone and time-intensive, increasing audit risk.  
- Regulatory expectations demanded structured traceability and automated data flows.  
- Data ownership was unclear across lines of business, leading to inconsistent controls and submission formats.  
- GDPR introduced data lineage and subject access obligations the firm could not meet reliably.

## My Role & Contributions
- Facilitated stakeholder workshops across Legal, Risk, Data Governance, and IT.  
- Mapped current-state manual reporting processes and identified failure points.  
- Conducted gap analysis between required regulatory outcomes and available system capabilities.  
- Authored business and functional requirements for reporting automation logic.  
- Used SQL and Excel to validate key regulatory data sets, ensuring integrity and accuracy.  
- Developed a regulatory traceability matrix linking controls, data sources, and compliance mandates.  
- Partnered with QA to define test scenarios for compliance use cases.  

## Challenges Faced
- Decentralized data ownership required extensive stakeholder coordination.  
- Ensuring consistency in regulatory interpretations across global regions.  
- Aligning legal, IT, and business definitions of “personal data” and “reportable client.”

## Key Deliverables
- Regulatory Requirement Matrix (FATCA, OSFI-B10, GDPR)  
- Data Flow Diagrams (Current-State & Automated Future-State)  
- Source-to-Target Mapping (Excel + SQL queries)  
- Functional Requirements Document (Confluence)  
- Risk Mitigation Plan & Issue Tracker  
- Test Cases for Regulatory Scenarios  

## Business Outcomes & Impact
- Reduced manual effort by 75% through automation of key compliance reports  
- Improved data accuracy and traceability, lowering regulatory audit exposure  
- Cut reporting cycle time from 7 days to 2 days for FATCA submissions  
- Enhanced regulator confidence with consistent, documented audit trails  
- Enabled centralized governance for data privacy and subject access requests under GDPR

## Visuals & Artifacts
(Include redacted samples or representations where possible)  
- Traceability Matrix (data elements mapped to regulation and control owners)  
- Sample SQL queries used in regulatory data validation  
- Visio data flow diagram (pre/post automation)  
- Functional spec excerpt (showing compliance logic)  
- Risk & Issue Log (compliance related)

## Reflection
This project showcased my ability to interpret and operationalize regulatory requirements across multiple frameworks and regions. I served as the bridge between compliance officers, business units, and technology teams — ensuring scalable and auditable solutions. It strengthened my regulatory knowledge and reinforced the importance of data governance and traceability in risk management.
