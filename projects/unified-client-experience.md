# Unified Client Experience Platform

## Overview
The firm aimed to modernize its fragmented client interaction landscape by launching a Unified Client Experience (UCX) platform. The platform integrated digital, call center, and in-person advisor interactions into a seamless experience.

## Business Problem

- Advisors lacked visibility into multi-channel interactions
- Fragmented systems caused delays and redundant data entry

- Facilitated co-design sessions and prototyped wireframes in Figma  
- Wrote 60+ user stories in JIRA covering onboarding, account management  
- Collaborated on acceptance criteria and UAT support  

## Challenges
- Channel silos with conflicting KPIs  
- Regulatory constraints impacting onboarding design  
- Change management for advisor adoption  

## Key Deliverables
- Journey Maps

## Results & Impact
